This repository contains my public Haiku HOME directory configuration files
(i.e. files in config/settings).

The main purpose of this repository is so I can easily share my current
configuration files with multiple systems I run Haiku on, but I've made it
public in case it is of interest to anyone else.

For any code found here that is not written by someone else and/or does not
have a specific license, you can assume it is licensed under the MIT License.
See [[file:LICENSE][LICENSE]].
